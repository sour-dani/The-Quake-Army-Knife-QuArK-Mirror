Now you have to confront Planojiva's infected workers to gain access to the castle's hidden dungeons that lead to Vensar's power generators. The castle is filled with powerful weapons and energy-boosts, which can come in handy, throughout your difficult mission, for both - you and the Planojiva's workers. Can you reestablish the harmony in which Vensar's inhabitants lived once or is their colony doomed for ever? Their fate is in your hands...<br><b>AUTHOR's COMMENTS</b> : A very powerful map as its title suggests. It has very nice architecture along with a very atmospheric theme. Plenty of cleverly-placed and timed-calculated power-ups. Features big battle areas, new-style teleporters, jump-pads, power-ups, many weapons and tricks to find out. It takes some time to master the map but it will certainly offer you a fragging(happy)... hour! Cheers to 'Endless Fragging'! Make sure to fill the field with at least 3 bots. Any other information you need, plus snapshots, can be obtained at : <a href=\"http://galileo.spaceports.com/~rogerdoo/q3a/rg3dm5/rg3dm5.htm\">http://galileo.spaceports.com/~rogerdoo/q3a/rg3dm5/rg3dm5.htm</a> Remember to update your links to my site with the new ones.

All powerups are reacable with the flight powerup, and by doing a rocket jump, or bfg jump (the case of the battle suit) the cobat armor (yellow) is rocket jumping reachable, and the red armour is falling reachable.

I'm very fond of rocket jumps, so you have to rocket jump to reach the Haste and you have to rocket jump to reach the battle suit. The quad damage is inside the fridge (yes, it's a fridge) near one of the teleporters. there's also a shotgun on the table in the kitchen, and one in the garden. (pretty dark where it is). there's also the combat armour (yellow) in a corner near the curved column and the other bulbs what sould I call them??). In the games room there's major's statue, there's a rippped snooker table with the lightning gun, and the battle suit on the light. In front of the door that leads to the garden there's the rocketlanucher, if you go to the left (considering you came from the garden) there's the grenade launcher and if you follow on there's the kitchen. if you turn right on the rocketlauncer there are the column and the bulbs and after those tere's the game room. if you follow on on the rocketlauncher, there's another door, that has a jump pad inside. this jump pad leads to another jump pad which leads to  the railgun area. this area has a see thru grid, where you can walk, and you can shoot at the garden and at the other parts of the house. by going into the garden ON the superior platform, you find the personal teleporter laying ar the end of it and there's the body armour on the \"tree\" :) . then there are four holes , 2 on each side,  to snipe into the house. that's about all of it. and again, in the jump pad area, if you jump on the first pad and try to lean back a little, you lead to another jump pad, which leads to the BFG. this was at the beginning a bug for bots, but it's fixed now. bots sometimes grab the bf, but not much, or at least, not in the skill I was playing. It's a kewl map for team dm."

We had hoped to create a group of maps that looked and felt as if they were made during the early days of quake 2, before all of the custom resources were created and imported into the world of q2 mapping.<BR><BR>I am very proud to say that I received enough points to attain 2nd place in the contest, and I can't thank all of the judges and mappers enough, for helping to make the contest such a success.<BR><BR>As for the map, it's big and slightly complex at first glance, with plenty of twists and turns and ups and downs throughout the various hallways. The largest of the indooor atriums is a multilevel structure that acts as a focal point for many of the different routes in that area. It hides the mega health up in a tough to reach alcove, and the powerscreen on the small bridge over a channel of lava. The quad and BFG are tucked away in the lower area that sports large clunky machinery and lava pipelines along with an assortment of other useful items.<BR><BR>Nearer to the top level, there are lifts from the areas below, the RA, and another series of tight interconnecting hallways that tie the level up into an intricate knot of pathways, with one leading to the only outdoor area in the map."

,"I started working on this map, while I was practicing dueling, due to my entry into the NADL. I really developed a liking for a map called \"The Rage\" (ztn2dm3.bsp) because it is so well layed out for a tense dueling match, with 2 main areas that are relatively equal in terms of weapons, armor and health. In this map, I tried my best to imitate this style and layout while adding a bit more vertical action and a bit more room to work with while attacking/defending. I find a slightly more open game to be much more enjoyable as compared to a 15 minute match that's all corner shots and spamming.<BR><BR>The two arena areas, are stacked with weapons that should balance well against each other, and there are plenty of paths to choose from when launching a sneak attack, or running before a stacked opponent. I tried to make sure that the item balance was reasonably similar for every spawn point as well, to insure a more enjoyable game, even if you're losing. In addition, I tried to maximize the  movement speed in the halls by including ramps instead of those stupid staircases that everyone seems to enjoy putting in their maps. A side-effect of this is relatively low r_speeds in most areas, and those are definitely a good thing in a dueling map."
